<!-- /* Create a vanilla JS application that consumes the
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ API and displays a dropdown list of pokemons.
When the user selects a pokemon from the dropdown, the application should make a
second API call using the "url" returned in the first API call to fetch the
pokemon's details, including its abilities, and display them on the page. Once
the details are fetched, they should be cached and the application should not
make another API call for that pokemon again. */ -->
